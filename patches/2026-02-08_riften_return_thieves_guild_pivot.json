On success, place the situational aspect 'Veiled Identity' with 1 free invoke; on Success with Style, gain 2 free invokes. Anyone actively trying to pierce the Veil must Overcome with Notice or Will against your Lore result. If you take Physical stress or a consequence while Veiled, the disguise flickers and you lose the remaining free invokes (the aspect may remain, but without free invokes)."
