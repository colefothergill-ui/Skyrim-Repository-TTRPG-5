  "notes": "Maven Black-Briar is the matriarch of the Black-Briar family and one of the most powerful people in Riften. She owns the Black-Briar Meadery, controls much of Riften's criminal activity, and has connections to both the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood. Maven is ruthless, manipulative, and absolutely intolerant of threats to her power. She uses blackmail, intimidation, and violence to maintain control. If the Empire wins the civil war, she becomes Jarl of Riften. The Thieves Guild operates with her blessing and protection in exchange for favors and a cut of major scores.",
