  "notes": "Aringoth is a High Elf who manages Goldenglow Estate, a highly profitable bee farm and meadery operation near Riften. He made the mistake of refusing Maven Black-Briar's 'offer' to buy into his business, not understanding that it wasn't actually a request. Maven has contracted the Thieves Guild to teach him a lesson by burning three of his beehives and clearing out his safe. Aringoth employs mercenary guards to protect the estate but is overconfident in his security measures.",
