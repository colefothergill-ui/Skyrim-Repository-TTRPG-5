## A1-S11 — Mirror Trial: Glass & Honningbrew Meadery Prep

### Scene Overview
**Location:** Riften — Ragged Flagon (Cistern) → Whiterun Hold — Honningbrew Meadery (Exterior)  
**Objective:** Complete Mirror Trial (Glass); receive Dampened Spirits assignment from Delvin; prepare for Honningbrew infiltration; initiate meadery operation  
**Outcome:** Mirror Trial completed successfully; Spell of Glass unlocked; Thalmor heat increases; Thalmor Justiciar neutralized via protocol pressure; basement access secured

---

### Narrative Summary

Following the successful Goldenglow Estate heist, Insaerndel took a well-earned rest in the relative safety of the Ragged Flagon's cistern quarters. However, rest in the conventional sense was denied — the Spell Tome of Quagmire called, its blank pages demanding another descent into the dream-mirrors of Vaermina's realm.

**Mirror Trial: Glass**

The trial manifested as a hall of crystalline reflections, each mirror showing a different version of Insaerndel — past selves, potential futures, and the masks worn to survive. The challenge centered on confronting self-betrayal and the fragmentation of identity that comes from living behind so many aliases.

**Key Trial Moments:**
- **Reflection Chamber**: Faced reflections of the "Dream Catcher," "Orinthelo," "Insaerndel the Wizard Consultant," and "Brynjolf's Magician" — each accusing the others of being the lie
- **Truth Test**: Required discerning which reflection held genuine memory versus illusionary fabrication
- **Mirror Shattering**: Accepted that all identities are real, none complete — embraced the fragmentation rather than seeking false unity

**Trial Resolution:**
- **Roll 1** (Will - Endure): Success — Withstood the psychological pressure of fractured identity
- **Roll 2** (Lore - Decode): Success — Recognized the trial's symbolic language and Vaermina's lesson about perception
- **Roll 3** (Notice - Spot Truth): Success with Style — Identified the true self as the synthesis of all masks, not a singular core

**Reward:** Spell of Glass unlocked — the ability to create illusionary duplicates through mirrored reflections

**Post-Trial: Thieves Guild Business**

Upon waking, Insaerndel found Delvin Mallory waiting with a new opportunity:

**Dampened Spirits - Honningbrew Meadery Job:**
- Maven Black-Briar seeks to cripple the Honningbrew Meadery's reputation and business
- Primary objective: Sabotage the meadery by poisoning their brewing vat with a "special ingredient"
- Secondary objective: Discover who Mallus Maccius (the inside man) is working for
- Decision point: Expose Mallus to Sabjorn or protect him for potential Guild leverage

**Intelligence Gathered:**
- Delvin provided a dossier on Honningbrew's layout, personnel, and security patterns
- The job requires traveling to Whiterun — increased risk given recent Battle aftermath and potential Thalmor presence
- Maven's interest suggests the Honningbrew matter ties into larger Black-Briar business interests

**Complications Accepted:**
- **Compel: "Informants Everywhere"** — Insaerndel's inquiries about Whiterun and Honningbrew in the Ratway did not go unnoticed. Someone will report the Altmer asking pointed questions, advancing the Thalmor search clock.

**Honningbrew Meadery Infiltration**

Armed with Delvin's intelligence and the necessary tools, Insaerndel traveled to Whiterun and approached the Honningbrew Meadery. Upon arrival, an unexpected complication presented itself: a Thalmor Justiciar was present, observing the meadery's operations.

**Confronting the Justiciar:**

Rather than risk exposure or violence, Insaerndel employed the Spell of Veils to disguise himself as a Whiterun Guard and used bureaucratic protocol pressure to handle the situation. Invoking guard authority and inspection procedures, Insaerndel successfully forced the Justiciar to observe from the upper level rather than interfere directly in the basement area.

**Outcome:**
- **Success with Style** — The Justiciar complied, securing private access to the basement for conversation with Mallus Maccius
- **New Complication** — The Justiciar began documenting the "inspector's" activities, creating a paper trail that could tie back to the investigation
- **Basement Secured** — Cleared the way for the critical conversation with the inside man without witnesses

This maneuver bought the operational space needed but came at a cost: the Thalmor now have documentation of a "Whiterun Guard inspector" taking unusual interest in Honningbrew's basement operations.

- The Pale connection from Goldenglow papers remains unexplored
- Arisann's trail grows colder with each passing day

**Character Development:**
- Insaerndel's relationship with fragmented identity deepens
- Growing comfort with wearing multiple masks simultaneously
- The cost of power: rest denied, dreams weaponized, heat rising

---

### GM Notes

- "Dream Catcher Search Intensifies"

---

**Honningbrew Basement Operations**

- Honningbrew (Basement): Destroyed the primary skeever nest behind the left cask-stack false slat.
- Used both free invokes from scene aspect "Ghost-Map of Honningbrew" on a Notice Overcome; Success with Style; kept the action silent (Basement Sweep remains 0/2).
- Gained Boost: "Contamination Packet" (physical proof useful for staging discovery/shutdown).
- Honningbrew (Basement): Staged the Contamination Packet as a discoverable evidence point; Create Advantage (Deceive) SWS → Scene Aspect "Evidence That Finds You" (2 free invokes). Justiciar Returns clock now 1/2.
- Swept and secured the secondary drain run quietly; Overcome (Notice) SWS → Boost "No Loose Ends". Basement Sweep remains 0/2.

---

**Honningbrew Operation Conclusion & Exfiltration**

With the basement sabotage complete and evidence meticulously staged, Insaerndel executed the final phase of the operation:

**Operation Wrap-Up:**
- Skeever nest destroyed, preventing future contamination while ensuring current vats were tainted
- Poison kit and Sabjorn's incriminating notes staged for Thalmor Justiciar discovery
- Mallus Maccius preserved as a Guild asset by directing Justiciar attention to Sabjorn's mismanagement
- Seized "Sabjorn's Ledger of Losses," "Whiterun Guard Contract Notes," and "Coded Shipment Schedule" as leverage

**Exfiltration:**
- Used Shadow Ward to vanish from the upper office before Justiciar investigation concluded
- Magical exit confounded Thalmor tracking attempts; Justiciar failed to trace arcane residue
- Successfully avoided leaving magical signature that could be traced back to specific identity

**Justiciar Seizure Initiated:**
- Thalmor oversight of Honningbrew Meadery officially triggered
- Investigation focused on Sabjorn's business practices and poison contamination
- Maven Black-Briar's interests protected; no trail leading to the Guild or Black-Briar operations

**Return to Riften:**
- Departed Whiterun Hold via carriage (10 Septims fare)
- Traveled to Riften to report mission success to Maven Black-Briar
- Secured Pale-route intelligence material for potential lead toward Arisann's location

**Consequences:**
- Thalmor search clock +1 (paperwork and oversight fallout from Justiciar involvement)
- Thieves Guild trust +1 (successful major operation with no exposure)
- Ready to negotiate with Maven for Pale-route information using seized evidence
