## Scene Breakdown

### A1-S7: Whiterun → Riften Road (Travel Montage)

**Objective:** Safe travel from Whiterun to Riften while avoiding Thalmor attention

**Montage Rolls:**
1. **Stealth (Good +3)** - Avoiding patrols and checkpoints → **Success**
   - Insaerndel took back roads and avoided main Imperial checkpoints where Thalmor agents might be stationed
   - Used Steed Stone blessing to maintain pace despite detours

2. **Notice (Good +3)** - Spotting potential threats → **Success with Style**
   - Spotted Thalmor patrol in advance near Valtheim Towers
   - Gained advantage aspect: "Know Their Patrol Pattern"

3. **Will (Fair +2)** - Dream-Mirror Descent compel accepted → **Success**
   - Insaerndel rested at a roadside camp
   - Accepted the "Dream-Mirror Descent" compel: rest did not clear stress, but unlocked Mirror Trial
   - Gained 1 Fate Point (now at 5 total)

**Dream Trial: Mirror of Veils**

*Setting:* A twisted reflection of the Riften marketplace, where every face is a mask and every voice an echo. Insaerndel navigates a crowd where everyone wears his face.

**Trial Rolls:**
1. **Will (Fair +2)** - Endure the disorientation of seeing himself everywhere → **Success**
   - Opposition: Fair (+2)
   - Pushed through the psychological pressure of fractured identity

2. **Lore (Great +4)** - Decode the illusion's symbolic meaning → **Success with Style**
   - Opposition: Good (+3)
   - Understood the trial's lesson: identity is a tool, not a prison
   - Gained aspect: "One Face Among Many"

3. **Deceive (Fair +2)** - Outplay the dream by becoming everyone and no one → **Success**
   - Opposition: Fair (+2)
   - Performed a "counter-veil" that collapsed the mirror trial

**Outcome:**
- Mirror Trial: Veils — **COMPLETED**
- Spell of Veils unlocked and added to character stunts
- Tome clock advanced: 1 → 2 (Phantoms, Veils complete; Dread, Glass remain)

**Spell of Veils Mechanic:**
> Because Insaerndel completed the Quagmire Mirror Trial 'Veils' and learned to wear illusion like a second skin, once per scene he may Create an Advantage with Lore to project a mundane disguise (face, voice, and clothing) that holds up under casual scrutiny. On success, place the situational aspect 'Veiled Identity' with 1 free invoke; on Success with Style, gain 2 free invokes. Anyone actively trying to pierce the Veil must Overcome with Notice or Will against your Lore result. If you take Physical stress or a consequence while Veiled, the disguise flickers and you lose the remaining free invokes (the aspect may remain, but without free invokes).

---

### A1-S8: Riften Gate — Veils Test

**Objective:** Enter Riften without drawing Thalmor attention

**Challenge:** Riften gate guards have been briefed about a "suspicious Altmer" matching Insaerndel's description (fallout from Whiterun publicity)

**Approach:** Test the newly-unlocked Spell of Veils

**Create Advantage Roll - Lore (Great +4) + Spell of Veils:**
- Result: **Success with Style**
- Created aspect: **"Veiled Identity: Nord Merchant"** with 2 free invokes
- Insaerndel appeared as a middle-aged Nord merchant with weathered features and practical clothing
- Voice altered to rough Nordic accent
- Guards waved him through without suspicion

**Scene Note:**
> The disguise held perfectly. No flicker, no tell. For the first time since the dream trial, Insaerndel felt the full weight of what Veils meant: he could walk past his own wanted posters and the guards would see someone else entirely.

**NPC Interaction:** Riften Gate Guard
- Guard: "Business in Riften?"
- Insaerndel (as Nord merchant): "Just trade. Heard the meadery's buying."
- Guard: "Keep your nose clean. Jarl doesn't like troublemakers."
- Guard waves him through

**Consequences:**
- Veils tested successfully in public
- No Thalmor Search Clock advancement
- Confidence in disguise capability established

---

### A1-S8: Riften Streets → Ragged Flagon

**Objective:** Navigate to the Ragged Flagon and deliver Olfrid's reply to Brynjolf

**Scene Context:**
- Veils dropped once inside Riften proper (to avoid guild confusion)
- Insaerndel moved through the city using guild routes and backstreets
- Arrived at the Ratway entrance without incident

**NPC Encounters:**
- Passed Maul (Maven's enforcer) - brief recognition nod
- Avoided Mjoll the Lioness (she's been asking questions about guild activity)
- Entered Ratway through standard guild access point

**Navigation:** No rolls needed (established guild member with known routes)

---

### A1-S8: Ragged Flagon — Brynjolf Debrief

**Objective:** Deliver Olfrid's sealed reply and report on Whiterun foothold status

**Scene Setup:**
- Ragged Flagon at evening capacity: guild members, merchants, Delvin at his desk, Vex sharpening blades
- Brynjolf near the Cistern entrance, reviewing ledgers
- Tonilia at the fence counter
- Atmosphere: Slightly more optimistic than usual (Whiterun success has spread)

**Dialogue: Brynjolf's Greeting**

> **Brynjolf:** "There you are, lad. Was starting to wonder if you'd gotten yourself thrown in an Imperial cell. How'd it go in Whiterun?"

> **Insaerndel:** "Battle-Born Arcana is ours. Twenty percent cut to Olfrid, full safehouse access, writ of privilege included. Olfrid sends his regards." *(hands over sealed reply)*

> **Brynjolf:** *(breaks seal, reads, nods)* "Well done. Olfrid's a careful bastard, but he knows value when he sees it. Says here you... 'demonstrated exceptional discretion during recent difficulties.' That's his way of saying you didn't get caught during a siege." *(laughs)* "You're making a name for yourself, friend. The right kind of name."

**Rapport Check - Brynjolf's Trust:**
- Current trust: 4/8 → advancing to 5/8
- Trigger: Major score that strengthens operations (+2 trust)
- Clean execution with no fallout
- Brynjolf's disposition: Impressed and increasingly confident in Insaerndel

**Information Exchange:**

> **Insaerndel:** "The Whiterun foothold came at a cost. I had to... make myself visible during the battle. Helped the Imperials. There might be heat."

> **Brynjolf:** "Heat we can manage, as long as it's not pointed at the guild. You kept us clean?"

> **Insaerndel:** "Battle-Born knows me as a wizard consultant. The guards know me as the Altmer who helped on the west wall. The guild connection stayed buried."

> **Brynjolf:** "Good. That's the kind of compartmentalization we need. Now, about your next job..."

### A1-S8: The Cistern — Guild Master's Briefing

**Scene:** Brynjolf leads Insaerndel into the Cistern for a formal briefing with Mercer Frey

**NPCs Present:**
- Mercer Frey (Guild Master)
- Brynjolf
- Vex (listening from her workstation)
- Delvin Mallory (at his desk, organizing contacts)

**Dialogue: Mercer's Assessment**

> **Mercer:** "So you're the one Brynjolf's been going on about. The Whiterun job was competent. Don't let it go to your head."

> **Insaerndel:** *(respectful but not subservient)* "I'm here to work, not collect compliments."

> **Mercer:** *(slight nod of approval)* "Good. Because I have a job that requires someone who can think on their feet. Goldenglow Estate."

**Briefing: "Loud and Clear"**

> **Mercer:** "Goldenglow Estate is a honey farm on an island south of Riften. It's been one of Maven Black-Briar's most reliable assets - until recently. The steward, an Altmer named Aringoth, has been skimming product and selling to competitors. Maven wants this stopped. Permanently."

> **Brynjolf:** "The estate's defended. Aringoth hired mercenaries after Maven started asking questions. He knows something's coming, just not when."

> **Mercer:** "Your objectives are simple:
> 1. Burn the beehives - but no more than three. We're sending a message, not destroying Maven's business.
> 2. Clear out the mercenaries.
> 3. Get into the estate, open the safe, and take Aringoth's ledgers.
> 4. Deal with Aringoth. Scare him, kill him, I don't care. Just make sure he understands who he crossed."

**Player Questions:**

> **Insaerndel:** "What about the island approach? Guards?"

> **Vex:** *(from her station)* "There's a dock on the north side. Mercenaries patrol in pairs. The estate has three floors - Aringoth's likely in his bedroom on the top floor. Safe's in there too."

> **Insaerndel:** "And if this goes loud?"

> **Mercer:** "Then you handle it. You've proven you can fight. But quiet is better. Maven doesn't want a spectacle - she wants compliance."

> **Brynjolf:** "You'll do fine, lad. It's a straightforward smash-and-grab with a bit of intimidation. Right in your wheelhouse."

**Mission Parameters:**
- **Primary Objective:** Burn beehives (max 3), obtain ledgers, intimidate/eliminate Aringoth
- **Secondary Objective:** Clear mercenaries, maintain stealth if possible
- **Success Condition:** Maven's message delivered, Aringoth neutralized, guild reputation enhanced
- **Failure Condition:** More than 3 beehives burned, ledgers not recovered, excessive collateral damage

**Resources Provided:**
- Map of Goldenglow Estate (provided by Vex)
- Mercenary patrol schedule estimates
- Lockpicks x10
- Optional: Poison from Tonilia (player choice)

### A1-S8: Planning Session — Delvin's Insight

After the briefing, Delvin pulled Insaerndel aside:

> **Delvin:** "Listen, lad. This job's important, but it's not just about Goldenglow. Maven's testing the guild - and Mercer's testing you. Do this clean, and doors open. Screw it up, and... well, Maven doesn't give second chances."

> **Insaerndel:** "Understood. Any advice?"

> **Delvin:** "Aringoth's Altmer, like you. Probably thinks he's smarter than everyone. Use that. He'll underestimate a Nord thief. He won't underestimate you if he sees what you really are." *(winks)* "That new face trick of yours might come in handy."

**Information: Search for Arisann**

> **Insaerndel:** "While I'm here... have you heard anything about a missing Altmer woman? My sister, Arisann. She disappeared into the Rift wilds months ago."

> **Delvin:** *(thinks)* "Arisann... Arisann... Name sounds familiar. I'll ask around. Rift's a big place, but someone always knows something. Give me a few days."

> **Insaerndel:** "I appreciate it."

> **Delvin:** "Family's important, lad. Guild helps its own. I'll put the word out."

**Clock Advancement:**
- **Search for Arisann:** 0/8 → 2/8
- Trigger: Guild network activated, credible investigation begun
- Delvin's contacts span the Rift and beyond

## GM Notes

### Pacing & Tone
This session successfully pivoted from civil war action to guild intrigue. The Veils unlock provided a satisfying character moment and new mechanical option. Goldenglow Estate will test player's stealth, combat, and decision-making skills.

### Future Hooks
- Arisann's trail is warming up (Delvin's investigation)
- Maven Black-Briar will take direct interest after Goldenglow
- Mercer's coldness hints at deeper issues
- Whiterun heat may resurface if Thalmor investigation continues

### Player Choices Emphasized
- Veils disguise opens new social infiltration options
- Goldenglow approach (stealth vs. combat) is player-driven
- Aringoth's fate (intimidate vs. kill) will shape Maven's perception
- Balance between guild loyalty and personal quest (Arisann)

### Next Session Prep
- Detail Goldenglow Estate map and mercenary positions
- Prepare Aringoth encounter dialogue trees
- Consider consequences of different approach methods
- Set up Maven's response scene
- Advance Arisann investigation with new lead
