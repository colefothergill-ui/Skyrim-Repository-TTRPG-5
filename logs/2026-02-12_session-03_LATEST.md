## A1-S11 → A1-S13 — "Dampened Spirits" (Honningbrew) + Maven Turn-In

### Scene Overview
**Location:** Riften → Whiterun (Honningbrew Meadery) → Riften (Bee and Barb)  
**Objective:** Ruin Honningbrew, frame Sabjorn, preserve Mallus, return to Maven  
**Outcome:** Success — vats poisoned, evidence staged, Mallus preserved, Maven satisfied; Arisann lead advanced

### Narrative Summary

Insaerndel accepted the Guild's next job and moved fast: Veils and authority were used as cover to access Honningbrew without tripping the wrong alarms. A Thalmor Justiciar's presence forced careful procedure—handled with cold protocol and sharper misdirection.

Once private with Mallus, the approach shifted: persuasion with receipts, not threats. Mallus yielded the poison and the documents needed to bury Sabjorn cleanly. Clairvoyant insight and phantom weaponry handled the infestation and logistics. Evidence was staged for inevitability; the vats were poisoned for permanence.

Insaerndel exfiltrated and returned to Maven at the Bee and Barb—this time not with a story, but with stacked paperwork. Maven confirmed the collapse and rewarded the efficiency, then revealed a concrete lead on Arisann's trail tied to a courier lattice called "The Ivory Thread."

Compel accepted at session end: Dominion paperwork begins to move. The net tightens.

### Mechanics &amp; Rolls (highlights)
- Veils disguise used to gain positional access at Honningbrew.
- Social leverage applied via Eloquent Scholar (Lore in place of Rapport/Deceive) to lock Mallus cooperation.
- Clairvoyance used to locate the infestation/vats with speed.
- Phantom Weaponry used to clear remaining pests quietly.
- Maven negotiation: Success → leverage + Arisann lead.
